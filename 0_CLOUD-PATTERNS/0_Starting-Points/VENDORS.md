# How to Select a Cloud Vendor

Selecting one or more cloud vendors is a key choice when adopting public cloud services.  I have done most of my production work with AWS or GCP.  However, for some scenarios, Azure or Alibaba Cloud are 'best fit' choices as well.  

The global market trends (shown below) can be seen as a starting point for you.

It is important to further refine your selection based on the following:

- **services needed** 
  - does a potential vendor offer your desired services in their cloud?
  - comparing service x vendor, which fits best?
  - example: does `AWS IoT` or `Azure IoT` better meet your needs?
- **services location(s)** 
  - does a potential vendor have your desired services in your preferred location(s)?
  - where are their data center(s)?
- **community cloud skills** 
  - what is the size of the total technical community for a potential vendor? 
   - what is the size of the local technical community in your geography for a potential vendor?
