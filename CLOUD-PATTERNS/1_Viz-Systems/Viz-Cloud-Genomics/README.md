Sequencing top level processes types are listed below and shown in the conceptual diagram:
- Wet lab / sequencer - prepped samples are sequenced on a machine
- **Primary analysis** pipeline of sequencer data - sequencer machine output files are analyzed
- **Secondary analysis** pipeline of primary analysis data - primary analysis output files are analyzed
- **Teritary analysis** pipeline of secondary analysis data - secondary analysis output files are analyzed
- Data storage and access - this includes genomic reference datasets, along with storage of genomic files all along these processes
