# Vizualize Cloud Genomic Pipelines

Examples used in understand building Bioinformatics data analysis pipelines on the public cloud.

## Overview

Sequencing top level processes:
- Wet lab / sequencer
- Primary analysis of sequencer data
- Secondary analysis of primary analysis data
- Teritary analysis of secondary analysis data
- Data storage and access

High level processes diagram shown below:
