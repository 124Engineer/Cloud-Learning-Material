## What is Here

This Repo contains links to **100+ resources** I've created for you to learn to work on the public cloud.  Links to artifacts are included for AWS, Azure, GCP or Alibaba Cloud.  I've also created a `CLOUD-PATTERNS` section to share best practice patterns and tools.

## 3 STEPS to getting started

1. 🤔 REVIEW - this Repo and FAQ
    - this repo is a companion to my **'Cloud Careers and Certifications`** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps-2) course on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It is designed to be a first course for those who are new working with public cloud services
    - ❓ FAQ - here are the top 10 questions students ask about `learning-cloud` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/FAQ.md)
2. 🤔 SELECT a **cloud vendor** (AWS, GCP...), set up a free trial (test) account for learning
    - See the main file in each vendor folders for links
      - for **AWS** go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`
      - for **GCP** go to `\GCP` folder -> `README.md`, etc...
    - Set up **MFA (multi-factor authentication)** on the root user account for your trial cloud account to protect against account misuse by others
      - setup up MFA on AWS root user account - [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html) 
      - setup MFA on GCP user accounts - [link](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/gcp/CloudIAM/enable-mfa-for-user-accounts.html)
    - Learn more about **cloud vendor differences** - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/VENDORS.md)
3. 💸 SECURE and SETUP a **budget alert** on your test account - I suggest alerting on spend of over $ 50 USD per day
    - follow **best practices** for security a demo account (AWS example) - [link](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/stop-aws-account-hacks-1bim)
    - pick a **scenario** or service to start learning
    - build your project on the cloud and Learn...repeat!
