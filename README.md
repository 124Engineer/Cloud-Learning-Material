## 3 STEPS to getting started

1. 🤔 REVIEW - this Repo and FAQ
    - this repo is a companion to my **'Cloud Careers and Certifications`** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps-2) course on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It is designed to be a first course for those who are new working with public cloud services
    - ❓ FAQ - here are the top 10 questions students ask about `learning-cloud` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/FAQ.md)
2. 🤔 SELECT a **cloud vendor** (AWS, GCP...), set up a free trial (test) account for learning
    - See the main file in each vendor folders for links
      - for **AWS** go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`
      - for **GCP** go to `\GCP` folder -> `README.md`, etc...
    - Learn more about vendor differences - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/VENDORS.md)
3. 💸 SETUP a **budget alert** on your test account - I suggest alerting on spend of over $ 50 USD per day
    - pick a **scenario** or service to start learning
    - build your project on the cloud and Learn...repeat!
