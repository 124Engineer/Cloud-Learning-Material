# Cloud Systems Visualization

Effectively visualizing cloud systems is key to not only building, but also growing and maintaining sytems.  There are a number of tools and techniques to use.
These include diagramming, drawing and connecting tools to existing (deployed) systems.  I did a series of keynotes about this topic as well.
